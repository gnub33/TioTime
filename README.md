# TioTime

Just a silly fan-site of Legend of Heroes character Tio Plato. 

TO DO:
  -Add space between tio icons and text
  -remove color from submit data entry bar
  -all caps on banner subheading
  -create hover states (maybe animations) for buttons and links
  -links redirect to seperate pages
  -add functionality to submit button
  
 **This was from a tutorial about html forms. I was just being silly.
